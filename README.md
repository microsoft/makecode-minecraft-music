## Overview

<img src='./icon.png'>

This extension is your music stop for Minecraft Education. Using the `/playsound` command underneath, the music blocks can help you hear popular Minecraft music discs like pigstep or make fun compositions with instruments or mob sounds. 

**Note** 
The extension can modify the volume at which the music plays, but will not modify the in-game music volume. If your music volume in your Minecraft Education world is low or off, you will not be able to hear the music from the blocks.
