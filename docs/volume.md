# Volume

Modify or get the volume at which the sounds, music, and notes will play in your Minecraft world and stop whatever sounds are playing.

```sig
music.setVolume(50)
music.stopSounds()
```

## Set Volume

Modify how loud any of the played sounds will be

# Parameters

* **volume**: the "loudness" of the sounds to be played on a scale of 0 to 100. If you have the volume set to 100, it will match the max volume that you set for the game. 

## Stop all Sounds

If there are any sounds playing -- either from a sound, note, or music disc -- this block will stop those sounds.
